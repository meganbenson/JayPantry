Project Overview
The Food Pantry Project is designed for the Jay Pantry located on campus to manage inventory, track users of the pantry, and handle checkout processes. The goal of this system is to make it easier for the donation center, the student workers, and the consumers with a user-friendly website connected to a functional database. 
We are working on the finishing touches of this project. There is currently a bug in the checkout feature, we need to add labels to the food in the pantry, and we need to talk to the donation center on how to implement the pantry at Elizabethtown. 
Task SSH-1 – Fix Checkout Functionality
Problem: The current "checkout" feature fails to remove items from the user's cart or transfer them to the "purchase" table.
Goal:  Find where the problem is using the data model. The last group told us that the issue may have arisen from a mismatch between the database structure and the final queries they made.
Outcome: When a user completes a checkout, the system removes items from the cart and adds them to the checkout table. Once the user completes the transaction, the system clears the shopping cart.
Task SSH-2 – Add Label Export Feature
Goal: Create a "Print Labels" button that allows users to export inventory information (item name, item number, and barcode)
Outcome: The system will generate printable labels for pantry shelves, improving organization and restocking efficiency.
Task SSH-3 – Data Entry and Staff Training
Goal: Meet with the food pantry staff to enter all current inventory items into the database and train staff on how to use the system for daily operations. 
Outcome: Ensure that the donation center fully implements the system and prepares it for use at Elizabethtown.
Expected Results
By the end of these tasks, the Food Pantry System will:
Have a fully functional checkout process.
Support exportable shelf labels for easier inventory management.
Be ready for real-world use by pantry staff with complete data and training.
